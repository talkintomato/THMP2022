									The idea for Labyrinth Coldrdige stemmed from the pervasive
									issue that our generation of youths face. Themed around
									introspection, friendship, social privilege and finding
									yourself, Labyrinth Coldridge hopes to inspire you to question
									if the life you are currently living is the one you truly wish
									to pursue, to get you to live your best life.
									<br /> <br />
									Labyrinth Coldridge is set in a female prison and follows the
									journey of Cass, an incarcerated young woman who is sentenced
									for embezzlement. Cass finds herself lost in the underground
									drug trade and thus caught in an endless maze of
									introspection. In the unlikeliest of places, she is challenged
									to forge her own path. Will she succumb to the pressures of
									prison? <br />
									<br />
									On a personal note, it has been an extremely tiring but
									enjoyable journey. Being faced with the constraints of
									COVID-19 and needing to juggle the weight of my school
									commitments has not been an easy feat. However, working
									alongside this amazingly capable cast and production crew has
									made this experience nothing short of enjoyable.
									<br /> <br />
									The production was only made possible through the collective
									efforts of our talented cast, production team and crew. A huge
									thanks to Jia Ning, Jermayne Yeo, Edward Loke, Gayle Tan,
									Darin Loh, Calysta Chng, Shiyun and Sophie Lau. Finally, thank
									you, the audience, for supporting Labyrinth Coldrdige. We hope
									that you will enjoy the musical as much as we do producing it!
